# Semi Autonomous Finite State Machines

## Final year project source code

### Stored here for posterity

> Written in C++,

Generates semi autonomous finite state machines based on a complex regex input.

This software is meant to interface with an OPCServer and provide control commands from the FSM based on the input from it.

> See something like KepServerEx5

Ui is implemented using SFML from 2013 (would need some work to update to use the newer framework)
